# MFFT
This is the official implementation repository for the MFFT algorithm. We will upload the training files and model files as soon as the paper is accepted.



## Data Validation

You can download the pre-extracted UAV-Satellite feature data by using the provided request template [here](./doc/request.md). 
Once the data is obtained, you can verify the results using the `evaluate_gpu.py` script.

You can also download the extracted feature file at [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_nvqqrJqtCX-rdbN-2Cd_g)
